# Adoption-App
This is my app project for my webdesign class, which I chose to be an app to help adoption and/or to find lost pets.
It has a profile for users, a feature for people who want to adopt and people who wants to pets for adoption, also there's another feature in case you've found or lost a pet.

P.S.: Since this was just a 5-month project because of the class's deadlines, it's still in early development
